- This repository contains the dataset used in a paper submitting to IoT Journal.
- The structure of the dataset is as follows:
  - `autonomous_robot` folder contains the dataset for Autonomous Robot application.
    - `compare_generalization` data of a sample run for comparing generalization of different orchestrators.
  - `smart_building` folder contains the dataset for Smart Building application.
    - `compare_accuracy` data of a sample run for comparing accuracy of different orchestrators.
    - `compare_late_ratio` data of a sample run for comparing late ratio of different orchestrators.

- The profiling folder contains profiles of different ML models on different edge devices while inference different subject classes.
